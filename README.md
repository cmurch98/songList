songHandler.py is a python program to be run on a linux os which takes Spotify Playlist ID's (max length = 100 playlists) and sorts the top 100 songs from this list into a new playlist. When called, this program requires an 'access token' argument which can be obtained from one of the websites listed in songHandler.py. Enjoy
